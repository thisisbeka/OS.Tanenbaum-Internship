Suppose that a university wants to show off how politically correct it is by applying the U.S.
Supreme Court’s “Separate but equal is inherently unequal” doctrine to gender as well as race,
ending its long-standing practice of gender-segregated bathrooms on campus However, as a
concession to tradition, it decrees that when a woman is in a bathroom, other women may enter,
but no men, and vice versa. a sign with a sliding marker on the door of each bathroom indicates
which of three possible slates it is currently in:
• Empty
• Women present
• Men present
In some programming language you like, write the following procedures:
Woman_wants_to_enter,man_wants_to_enter, woman_leaves, man_leaves. You may use
whatever counters and synchronization techniques you like.
Counter and Synchronization Technique
Consider that the value of MUTEX is equivalent to 1, let the value of ManM is equals to 1, WomanMX = 1, 
ManC leaves is equal to 0, woman leaves WomanC = 0, thus the state is 
ManC = ManC+1
up(ManM)
man is bathing

In the condition where woman_wants_to_enter:
dwn(WomanM)
If(WomanC = 0) dwn(MUTEX)
WomanC = WomanC+1
up(WomanMX)
woman is bathing

In the condition where Man_leaves:
dwn(ManM)
ManC = ManC-1
If(ManC = 0) up(MUTEX)
up(ManM)

WomanC = WomanC-1
If(WomanC = 0) up(MUTEX)
up(WomanMX)
